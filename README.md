# Machine_Learning
This repository contains the Learning process and projects used during learning data science
and machine learning.

So hey reader, This repository is created during i started learning data science and
machine learning and created different projects during the learning phase.

note: some projects are copied from different sources including Github just for learning process.

# Things to learn :

## 1) Mathematics 
such as statistics and probablity theory are most important to understand the output of the ML 

## 2) Important Libraries (still updating)
### Pandas
### numpy 
### matplot library
### tensorflow
### scikit-learn


## 3) Basic knowledge of:(still updating)
     INITIALIZATION
     preprocessing of data
          Getting Business Knowledge
          Data Exploration
          missing value treatment
          Outliers Treatment
          Dummy variable creation
          splitting data into test, train and validation data
          Standardizing the data
          Correlation Analysis
          
     Difference between Overfitting model, underfitting model and A good model
     Batch Gradient descent
     Neural Network
     
 ## 4) projects:

   ### 1) Regression based project 
   ### 2) Mnist Dataset project
   ### 3) NLP project
   ### 4) Time series Project(coming soon)
   ### 5)
  
  
## 5) Important Research Papers to read:
