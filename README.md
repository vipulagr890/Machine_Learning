# Machine_Learning
This repository contains the Learning process and projects used during learning data science
and machine learning.

So hey reader, This repository is created during i started learning data science and
machine learning and created different projects during the learning phase.

note: some projects are copied from different sources including Github just for learning process.

# Things to learn :

## 1) Mathematics 
such as statistics and probablity theory are most important to understand the output of the ML 

## 2) Important Libraries (still updating)
### Pandas
### numpy 
### matplot library
### tensorflow
### scikit-learn


## 3) Basic knowledge of:(still updating)
     preprocessing of data
     Difference between Overfitting model, underfitting model and A good model
     Batch Gradient descent
     The domain of Work
     Neural Network
     
 ## 4) projects:
   ### 1) Real State Price Prediction (Provides great insight for begineers in linear regression)
   ### 2) Stock price prediction (Provides grreat insight in Time series data) 
   ### 3) clustering project
   ### 4) classification based project (Provide great insight in classification problem and logistic regression)
   ### 5)
