# Machine_Learning
This repository contains the Learning process and projects used during learning data science
and machine learning.

So hey reader, This repository is created during i started learning data science and
machine learning and created different projects during the learning phase.

so first project is about linear regression. basically, linear regression is about preparing
data sets and predicting possible outcome about any given condition using those data sets.


note: some projects are copied from different sources including Github just for learning process.

# Things to learn :

## 1) Mathematics 
such as statistics and probablity theory are most important to understand the output of the ML 

## 2) Important Libraries (still updating)
### Pandas
### numpy 
### matplot library
### tensorflow
### scikit-learn


## 3) Basic knowledge of:(still updating)
     preprocessing of data
     Overfitting
     Batch Gradient descent
     The domain of Work
     
 ## 4) projects:
   ### 1) Real State Price Prediction (Provides great insight for begineers in linear regression)
   ### 2) Stock price prediction (Provides grreat insight in Time series data) 
   ### 3) clustering project
   ### 4) classification based project (Provide great insight in classification problem and logistic regression)
   ### 5)
